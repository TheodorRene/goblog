# Hei
I've been thinking about setting up a blog for some time now. Hopefully there
will be more than this initial post, but you know how it is. There is probably a
million posts out there like this one. Default theme, initial post, hello world
type stuff. 


## Setup
The page is made using Hugo and is deployed through Netlify. I might write a
more comprehensive post about it later. There link to repo is [here]("https://github.com/TheodorRene/blog"). I'm still learning the possibilities with Hugo but the most important
thing is get the site up and have an easy way to write posts.
