        <h1>Blog</h1>
        <h1>Hei</h1>
<p>I've been thinking about setting up a blog for some time now. Hopefully there
will be more than this initial post, but you know how it is. There is probably a
million posts out there like this one. Default theme, initial post, hello world
type stuff.</p>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>The page is made using Hugo and is deployed through Netlify. I might write a
more comprehensive post about it later. There link to repo is <a href="%22https://github.com/TheodorRene/blog%22">here</a>. I'm still learning the possibilities with Hugo but the most important
thing is get the site up and have an easy way to write posts.</p>
