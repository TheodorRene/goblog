<p>Summary of my time at my first time at Lambda_days_2023!</p>
<p>Most of these summaries are what I got from the talk, not neccesarily what the
speaker wanted to say with the talk.</p>
<p>Talk1: Learning kids FP</p>
<p>I was a bit skeptical on the notion of learning kids FP. In some way I think of
FP as difficult, but I think it mostly comes down to what perspective you have.
Impertive programming languages were mad based on how computers work. But is
that really neccesary in this day and age? When you look at the syntax its must
closer to math, and then easier for kids and new prorammers to reason about.
This can make learning about computer science, and not just small implementation
details of some language (looking at you public final static main java!). And
often a GC-programming language works for most problems. Why have to think about
the arcitechure, when you can just code that is easier to read and reason about?
That was my takeaway</p>
<p>Talk2: Bringin Lambda to Excel
Wow, Excel is crazy, Microsoft seems to put a lot of time and effort into keep
innovating with Excel. They have introduced Lambdas, or functions. Giving you a
much more expressive programming language to work with your cells. And as they
say Excel is the biggest functional programming language. I think Excel as a
tool is really interesting. And i discussed this with my fellow norwegian at the
conference. People sit day in and day out working in Excel not realising that
they are in fact programming!</p>
<p>Another interesting tidbit is the way of distributing these code snippes are
through gihtub gists. Seems like an attack vector. &quot;yeah just use this gist in
your spreadsheet, dont look throught it&quot;</p>
<p>They also did this in the public sphere and used the feedback to iterate on the
product. Listening to feedback on the forums, HN and youtube.</p>
<p>Talk3: Blue green deployment
I didn't understand much of this talk, just that kubernetes is f*kn complicated.
I was just thinking is there really no other way of doing it? They had stateful
pods because of the use of Erlang and websockets, with live auctions</p>
<p>Talk4: when testing doesnt cut it</p>
<p>formal verification is very interesing, but I'm not sure if I'll really
understand how it works. Did you know airplanes have formally verified C
compilers? He talked about a common digital currency project, and how a core of
this would be nice to be formally verified. He showed everything but the
interesting part, the implementation ( because of IP issues). So it just sounds
great, but I have no idea how you do it, and how it scales in a system</p>
<p>Talk 5: Conor
I've been following Conor for a while on youtube and was really exctied to see a
talk about combinators,which are often mentioned in his videos. First of all,
this man can speak reaaaally fast without losing any momemtun. I tried APl, all
well and good</p>
<p>Talk 6: Easy dependent types
It was not easy, I couldn't grasp the example. Its just how it is. These
conferences gathers people with different interest and I don't think everyone
can indulge in every aspects of functional programming.</p>
<p>Talk 7: Delimited continuatines
I fell off quite quick. I though I understood algebraic effects somehow, but
this was no the same thing? She is atleast working on implementing this in GHC.
She has some great blogposts if you haven't heard about her:</p>
<p>Day 2!</p>
<p>Talk 2.1: Verse!
Wow really interesing. functional logic. How is this different from Prolog? No
one was talking about that, but Tim Sweeney seemed to light up when i mentioned
this to him in a chat-session in the &quot;chillout room&quot;. interesing to see how it
will evolve. Tim is a biiig language nerd, with a long successfull CV. I can't
believe he is a CEO of one of the biggest gaming companies.</p>
<p>Talk 2.2: Gren
The norwegian talk! Gren is elm for the backend and the frontend. And the
comments on how we need a easy to learn language, which makes it hard to make
mistakes and can run anywhere is still a missing puzzle. Most application don't
need to be lighting fast, so don't let it come in the way of API</p>
<p>Talk 2.3: Unison!
really exciting. content-addressable functions, effect systems, plans of a
distributed system. No textfiles for code?</p>
<p>Talk 2.4: livebook</p>
<p>Jupyter notebooks is nice. But notebooks for a functional programming language?
Much nicer! It lets you handle dependency between cells much easier. And it
includes simple graphical possiblites of exploring, which I think notebooks
really are meant for. I believe any programming course should have a notebook</p>
<p>after this I was tired, and retired back to the hotel. All in all, a great
experience. Many interesting speakers, and topics</p>
